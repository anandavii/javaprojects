# Number Java Project

This project demonstrates working with arrays and ArrayLists in Java. It consists of two main classes: `Number` and `NumberOperation`.

## Number.java

This class contains the main method where random numbers are generated, stored in an ArrayList, and then transferred to an array. It also utilizes methods from the `NumberOperation` class to perform operations on the array.

## NumberOperation.java

This class implements methods for performing various operations on an array of numbers, including calculating the total sum, average, highest, and lowest values.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `Number.java` file to execute the program.

## Class Descriptions

### Number.java

- **Purpose**: Main class to demonstrate array and ArrayList operations.
- **Methods**:
